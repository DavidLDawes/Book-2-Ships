# Book 2 Ships
Reproducing the original Traveller Book 2 Ship Design System in a simple UI with some automation - around crew and staterooms, tonnage and eventually costs.

Playing with Go UI code to learn more is the primary motivation, but I might as well make a useful tool (well, useful for a nerd like me) while I am at it.
